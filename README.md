## 📖 Project Overview

AATAM (AI-Centric Agent Threat Analysis Model) is a threat analysis framework specifically designed for AI Agent systems. With the rapid development of AI Agent technology, traditional threat models can no longer effectively address emerging security challenges. This project proposes an AI-centric threat analysis approach to help developers and security researchers identify, analyze, and mitigate security risks in AI systems.

### 🎯 Why AATAM is Needed?

- **Reality-Driven**: Based on numerous real AI security incidents and vulnerability cases
- **Traditional Model Limitations**: Traditional threat models cannot adapt to the complex scenarios of AI Agents
- **Emerging Threats**: AI systems face new types of attacks such as indirect prompt injection and model poisoning
- **Frequent Vulnerabilities**: Well-known AI tools like Cursor frequently expose high-risk security vulnerabilities

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔍 AI-Centric Data Flow Analysis
- **Bidirectional Data Flow**: Analyzes data flows with AI as both endpoint and starting point
- **Entity Classification**: Categorizes system entities into five major types: Model, Environment, Ecosystem, Expansion, Human
- **Threat Modeling**: Systematic threat analysis combined with STRIDE model

### 🛡️ Comprehensive Threat Coverage
- **Model Layer Threats**: Jailbreak, training data poisoning, AI platform poisoning
- **Environment Layer Threats**: Command injection, sandbox escape, unauthorized access
- **Ecosystem Layer Threats**: Supply chain attacks, MCP tool poisoning
- **Expansion Layer Threats**: New manifestations of traditional security vulnerabilities in AI scenarios
- **Human Layer Threats**: Social engineering attacks, misinformation propagation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Understanding the AATAM Model
- **[Chinese Detailed Documentation](./DOC/AATAM-ZH.md)** - Complete model introduction
- **[English Documentation](./DOC/AATAM-EN.md)** - English version of the model
- **[Entity Threat List](./DOC/Threat-List.md)** - Threat classification checklist

### 2. AATAM Methodology Three Steps

#### Step 1: AI-Centric Data Flow Mapping
1. Identify system entities (Model, Environment, Ecosystem, Expansion, Human)
2. Draw bidirectional data flow diagrams centered on Foundation Model

#### Step 2: Threat Analysis
- Input threat analysis: Identify attack vectors
- Output threat analysis: Analyze using STRIDE model

#### Step 3: Risk Mitigation
- Permission restriction strategies
- User authorization mechanisms

## 📊 Threat Entity Classification

| Entity Type | Main Threats |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Model** | Jailbreak attacks, model backdoors, adversarial attacks |
| **Environment** | Command injection, sandbox escape, unauthorized access |
| **Ecosystem** | Supply chain attacks |
| **Expansion** | Traditional security vulnerabilities |
| **Human** | Social engineering attacks, false advertising |

## 💡 Practical Application Cases

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Threat Analysis
The project uses the currently popular MCP application as an example to demonstrate the application of the AATAM model in detail:

- **Data Flow Analysis**: Complete MCP system data flow diagram
- **Threat Identification**: Discover 20+ specific threat scenarios
- **Attack Paths**: Analyze real attack cases such as Cursor client RCE
- **Mitigation Measures**: Provide specific security protection recommendations
